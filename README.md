==============


This repo contains the solutions for the exercises from for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning  course (https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud120).  I originally took the course over the holiday break at the end of 2017.  
The exercises are written in Python.  Originally the code was Python 2.x but I have upgraded each exercise to work in Python 3.7. 
The exercises utilize a few key libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, NLTK (natural language toolkit) and numpy
Some of the excercises also use a dataset of emails from the Enron scandal.

It was an excellent course covering fundamental of AI and Machine Learning.
